title: 'First NextJS App'

This is my first ever try at creating a NextJS app. This is created by following the **tutorial**
that is officially available on the nextjs website. The experience of creating a nextjs app was very
smooth. The development time is minimal.

I think this is a great framework and really does help the developer improve productivity and
solely focus on the important tasks rather than spending time fixing issues not so relevant to
the use-case.

So today marks the day, that I finally develop and deploy an application based on nextjs. I do
have plans to modify this to perhaps improve the capabilities of this simple blog in the **future**.
