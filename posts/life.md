Well what exactly is life anyway, when you think about it, sometimes it makes sense
but other times it doesn't. So how do we even talk about life. But somehow we gotta
survive and we gotta have what we call a 'life'. Because life is precious. Life is
the most crucial thing in life. Life is water. A water brand in Maldives. Gotcha!!!
Hahahaha!
