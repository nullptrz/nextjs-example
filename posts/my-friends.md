This is a list of my **close** friends:

- Aiham
- Azu
- Iuzaaz
- Hibee (Rau)
- Zaidhooni
- Sudhudhu

They are great people and one of them is an impostor...so you know how it goes,
we all gotta blame and **Aiham** loves creating conspiracy theories, which sometimes turn out to be
true. He is a smart detective type guy.

Then there is **Iuzaaz**, a tall dude who loves teasing others about how short they are
(but in reality this dude is taller than normal people in our country). He is the guy
who always get backstabbed while innocently waiting for some munees kitchen goodies in cafeteria.

Then there is **Zaidhooni** a beautiful dhooni who happens to be perfect at lying and deception.
He is also one of the sneaky-beaky like players who happens to get caught by people
while emerging from a vent.

Then there is **Azu**, a very innocent girl who sadly happens to get accused of being the impostor
all because of her suspicious movements. She is also very daring and would not back down
in a stand-off. (That's right guys don't go for a stand-off with her she is ruthless in those scenarios)

Now we come to the **Sudhudhu**, a calm, relaxed guy who happens to follow around his friends and
has hard time getting away with murder. But he is a proficient in being safe, (probably cause he
holds down the shift key while moving **Shhhhhh!!**)

And finally, ya'll been waiting for this, the one and only Hibaru A.K.A **Hibee**. A very determined girl
with lots of hope who finishes tasks. Humorously, this girl does not procrastinate in the game.
She is a very active girl. But she also has trouble getting away with murder so you know,
a very easy to find impostor.

That's it for this episode of craziness... Hope you guys had a good read.
